        <p>
            Here is some information on cars based on your keywords:</p>

        <p> Cars are motor vehicles with wheels that run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels,
            and mainly transport people, not cargo. They use an internal-combustion engine and a volatile fuel to power
            them. The first true car was a steam-powered tricycle made by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769. The modern car
            was invented in 1886 by Carl Benz.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cars have various features and controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and safety. Some of these
            include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Cars also
            have different types and models depending on their size, shape, design, performance, and purpose. Some of
            the common types are hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, luxury cars, sports cars, etc.
        <p>
            Cars have both costs and benefits to the individual and society. The costs include acquiring the vehicle,
            interest payments, repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes,
            insurance, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at
            the end of its life. The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.
            Cars are also considered an essential part of the developed economy.
